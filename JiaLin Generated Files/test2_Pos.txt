Also, when you have a circuit that is not working, a thermal camera will often quickly tell you which component is responsible.

I had been eyeballing these for looking for wildlife (or sasquatch!) at night in the woods. I wasn't sure the range would be far enough to be useful though. Looked like you were getting pretty outdoor range with it though. Now I want one for sure :>

You should try viewing the drain pipes under a sink with hot and cold water , it looks pretty neat . \nAlso pouring hot water into the toilet or a bucket looks pretty nifty as well.. Good video , I am glad someone is as excited about it as I am ..:) Hopefully one day I'll be able to get the one with the high frame rate .

My engineering and physics teachers have used your videos in class many times to explain stuff.

Thank you for all the educational, and hilarious, moments!\n\nAlso the thermal sensor is awesome!  I'm applying for University soon, hoping to get into the ECE course there, do you have any tips regarding classes?
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   you read my mind with your heat seeing devices. I have been thinking of getting one to find out where the insulation has collapsed in my old home to minimize damage to the walls when I try and re insulate this summer (Winnipeg so no go in the winter). great looking product and as always, you make it fun and entertaining.

Between the literal drill holes in my walls to debugging overloaded power supply circuits. I've always wanted this tools in my workshop, but could never afford one on a college budget :/ Awesome Video!

Love your videos! I'd love to see more applications of cool electrical thingamajigs like this! I really like what Thomas Kim and Ludic Science do but you're much more entetaining :3

I wasn't sure if the windows are leaking so this would be a good way to find where the air is going.

I would have appreciated this more than any other human on earth.

I could use this to monitor heat output on the circuit boards I design as an EE student. Plus all of the other cool uses showed in the video.

I was thinking about how to convert heat loss to energy loss (GJ). Do you have any ideas? I was thinking about estimating the U-value of my house by using thermal imaging and also working on the Plank Law. Any thoughts on this? Thanks!

Like your video so much👍 I used to have an issue with heat loss in my home. Then, I bought Infiray T2S+ thermal camera. I think that it's also a great device to find all the heat loss points in the house. The imaging is quite good for such an affordable price.

Then tighten up that level (from what I could tell the span was ok). Finally never, ever, ever say you’re looking at the temperature since this type of thermography is only qualitative. I could go into the multiple reasons for this but unless you’re using some thermocouples and or thermistors (ideally) don’t mention anything about temps. Just my 0.02$.

Also, using an OTG cable you can also record using smarthphone, so you can record on the fly. The resulting video is only what is shown on screen, no data or visible image. My camera firmware is v1.1.2

It doesn't do a lot but what it does it does great. What really stinks about it though is the support and the software. I think the software is what makes or breaks such a camera, the display is nice to get information on a glance, ensure the correct settings and make sure you capture everything you want to capture but where those cameras really shine is the after-the-fact image analysis (or "report generation") and that is where FLIR really sucks. The free FLIR Tools have been last updated 2014,only  a few months after I bought the camera... They're slow, they lousy, effectively abandonware and this camera doesn't have the required firmware to do live capture so you have to go through a rather time consuming shoot/analyze cycle...\n\nI'd really love to hear how good or bad the UNI-T software is... whatever my next thermal camera will be, it's definitely not going to be from FLIR.

For the typical homeowner, someone who just needs a toolbox camera, or maybe for some computer troubleshooting, these cheep little cameras do the trick just fine. When serious thermal analysis needs to be done in a professional setting or when you NEED to know the temperature of a something, I'd buy a FLIR. They cost alot more but...well let's just say that you get what you pay for.

It seems many people have serious doubts about that spec

I love it, great for electronic work and such bang for the buck when you consider the thermal resolution.

Also, a tip, you could buy cheap macro lens (used in CO2 laser) and you get macro focus point. That  FLIR is no competitor

Still working well, and I think they do some higher resolution models now.

In your video you say that it's only possible to capture video in the provided software.  But I use my UTi260B in OBS without problems to capture the thermal video stream.   (however it only works with direct cable to my PC, not via USB3 hub).

It was out of stock for many months. Looking forward to finding all the hot spots around my house. Thanks for all you videos.

It would be interesting to buy this one and compare it with the TG267.

I want to use it mostly for heat loss of my house, pluming, electrical fuses, etc.

Very nice review btw! I will be recieving the 260E tomorrow, I can"t wait to try it out.

It was a great product. I believe I bought it for about $9,000. It had a fusion system where thermal was fused with visible. I used it to inspect motor control centers, high power connections, fuses etc.  It was purchased to replace an old, $50,000 FLIR camera.

You need to spend a lot more to reach the features and often even the quality of an UNI-T with renowned established brand. I use one of their multimeters for more than 6 years and I am very very happy with it, it was a steal compared to the big name brand F__K_ what were you all thinking!? 😄

Thanks so much.

I'm not a fan of non-replaceable batteries. I'm assuming you can replace it if it's a 26650. Thanks for your help!

I would expect the FOV of the newer camera to be 5/3 more....(50deg / 30 deg)  Do you have any explanation for this?  it seems like manufacturers specs are often not reliable and is most likely the case here. \n\nGreat video thank you for sharing.

Especially seeing that one of the meters was inaccurate by almost 10 degrees.

                                                                                     Superb review. Thank you.\n\nLooks like a great value gadget for those wanting to explore the pros and cons of thermal imaging before emptying the wallet/purse on a device that has top-of-the-range characteristics.\n\nWhile I have an expensive Hik unit that is clearly not in the same league, if I was limited to sub-12ftlb shooting or just watching nature in the garden, I'd be very tempted to give it a try, especially given that you can record sound too.\n\nThis reminds me very much of my first home-built IR system and the biggest drawback with that set-up was the notable battery drain, which rendered my phone dead pretty quickly - maybe the current draw of this device isn't the same though? With that said, I wonder if there is a missed opportunity to incorporate a a 2x 18650 battery holder in the handgrip (along with a suitable voltage regulator). So, plug the thermal unit into the handle directly and then use the cable to connect the handle to the phone perhaps? Doubt it would cost much more to produce and would allow the user to add their own batteries for improved longevity if it's important to them.

You could leave it set up and just add your phone when needed. Good review 👍👍

I was looking at hand held monoculars today with a view to buying one but I think I’m gonna go for this & save quite a bit money. Cheers buddy 👍🇬🇧

I do feel you have given that to us. It seems to be a great product, and reasonably priced as well. Thank you, and cheers from Texas.

I would like to know if I could use it for circuit repair to find hotspots on a circuit board that could be a possible fault. I have an old one and I would like to replace it plus use it for hunting so it's a double win for me if it's possible.

I have been a certified thermographer for about 15 years and use a high end FLIR for inspections of electrical gear. Good explanation of reflectivity, emissivity and transmittance. Most casual users don’t know about these pitfalls of infrared thermography. Hollywood doesn’t help… When people see a movie and cops are using IR to see through buildings to locate bad guys, I have to explain that’s not possible. What you demonstrated with tinfoil is a great demo of emissivity and reflectivity. Tinfoil does serve a purpose in thermography while in the field. When using infrared on a items with high emissivity, I will use a piece of tinfoil to measure background temperature. Wad up the foil and unfold it multiple times so the surface is full of micro wrinkles. Point the dull side toward the area you need a reflected temperature then point the IR camera at the tinfoil. The dull finish and micro wrinkles provides a good average temperature of the area it’s pointing. I can enter the reflected temperature into the reporting software to obtain an accurate component temp. Obviously you want to shoot at an angle so your body temp is not included in the average temp seen in the reflection of the foil.

I obviously had a lot more exploring to do . I was particularly impressed with the see-thru garbage bag and the temperature difference you see in the Boot-prints while walking through the snow.

They pay you pennies on the dollar compared to "real" advertising, yet your video is very effective at making me want to buy one of these.\nIt looks very fun, but also useful. My favorites were the stud finder and wire tracer.

I really enjoyed the examples of infrared interactions at the end. I love that you included the ffmpeg command. The dual camera setup is great too! I hope these thermal cameras keep coming down in price.

I never knew such an alternative world existed but now that I do, I want one of those! As a carpenter, what an excellent way to find studs, cables, pipes and so on, anywhere in a building - but it's also a fun and unique eye-opener in everyday life.

It was really neat to see so much IR video all at once like that.  You just get so used to seeing the world in visible light that its always a bit startling to see the world differently like this.  Maybe TOPDON will release a UV camera one day and you can build a triple mount.

Fun fact, few years ago the cheap FLIR ones were only 9hz because of US export restrictions on IR cameras. Now the cheap chinese ones can give you glorious 25FPS / Hz IR!

The emissivity of different materials and surface finishes is fascinating too, so I would be keen to see how you tackle that subject Matthias. Thank you, always learning with you.

Thanks Jeff. I having insulation issue all over the house. I am noticed it a lot this morning because it’s 50 outside. Btw, loved the investigation done in that Miami condo.

I plan on air sealing in my attic, high hats/fixtures, fans, and outlets.

I own a few Klein Tools and have been happy with them. I appreciate you taking the time to show how to read and interpret your findings.

I think this will work well for that.

If you could do a review on it, it would be awesome. I want to see how it compares in video quality to the HF one or similar.

Doing RF work right now and working on my MSEE in antenna and microwave engineering.\n\nAnyway, no wonder I liked your channel right away. Must have been my EE-dar detecting a fellow EE haha

I got it to check my electric panel and electric outlets. Paranoid over too much electrical stuff. 😁

It really amazed me because it supports secondary analysis of the temperature data in the thermal images. And I can connect it directly to the smartphone for plug-and-play accurate temperature measurement. Very convenient!

It's in fact the outlet itself. The visible and infrared images don't always align. There may be a setting to help adjust.

I use several Flir products, E96 backed up with a Protimeter moisture meters MMS3. I like the built in hydrometer. Nice video uncovering many issues-we never have enough tools in the moisture and thermal imaging inspection business. Thank for the video

I appreciated your video.  Thanks for posting.

Before such an investment I want to make sure the tech actually works. This video was super informative and I feel much better about spending that much money on a tool I’m going to be using daily. Thanks!

It seems it will suit me perfectly!

What do I have to consider when entering the measurement parameters? Can I leave the default settings as they are or do I have to change them (e.g. emissivity)?

Would this work looking for hot air coming in?

All of the product review I each so far are bad. They show the product but they don't walk around showing it like the way you did. \nI will be buying one soon and be a video about it soon. I see fun things with it and also to check where the cold air in coming in from my home to so I can fix the problem. Great video. I enjoy it. Thanks.

So I bought Infiray T2 Pro thermal monocular as a birthday gift for him. It's cost-effective and my son loves it so much.

I wish I had a camera like this. it'd make for cool scenery photos
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           You said the HTI HT-191 at the end with a sensor of 320x240 was "easily the highest of any on the list" but your #3 seek reveal pro has the same resolution. As a general rule, I don't trust any research that's done based on  "reading customer reviews". This almost always means just seeing what has the highest Amazon ratings. Does anyone seriously trust Amazon reviews anymore?
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Looks like sponsored ad. Why not mention Infiray devices? I have Infiray T2L attached to my phone via USB-C and it rocks! Manual focus is so great and 25 fps @ 288x192 thermal sensor makes it number one. Alu body, top quality for the price 1/3 of seek thermal reveal pro... Why havent you done deeper research on the market? All these shitty videos about "top super hiper best" are just shitty and showing no respect to us - Viewers. Channel banned. And this is mine, not sponsored opinion.

Like finding leaks in the insulation of your house in winter.  Or finding where your cat is hiding in your bedroom.

This made a thermal camera well worth it for me.

That way you could set something down in front of it and depending on the size and how far away it was, you could adjust the parameters to measure the X, Y of where the hot pixels are and know very accurately where the component is. It just wouldn't be a handy handheld tool for quick observations.

Not an easy task to beat manufacturers in having great products!

They are very affordable IR modules with a USB interface, but it's all proprietary. I think they managed to crack the older models but the newer models only produce a raw unprocessed image last time I looked into it.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 One thing the commercial camera does that the DIY version does not is overlay the thermal image, which has a fairly low resolution, over a very basic black and white visible image. It gives a lot better view into what's actually going on. If you were to add that to the DIY project, and say, replace the ESP32 with a Raspberry Pi Zero and camera module to add the visible image display, this project can be a lot better.

I feel like just a few days ago I was thinking about this exact same problem.

Thanks a lot! 😃\nEven though it didn't work out, it's a fantastic starting point! I bet we're going to see a fully functional IR camera pretty soon! 😃\nAnyway, stay safe and creative there! 🖖😊

It does a good job. I've used it to find thermal "leak" around the house, monitored wheel bearing temps on my travel trailer as well as using it for monitoring my electronic circuits.

Huge value, and you can Google it easily.

The resolution is about half way between your DIY and the FLIR; I've used it now and then for troubleshooting and/or augmenting my videos with stills - as it cannot record video. But then, the price was also half way between your options: about 250$ IIRC.

But anyways, this was a good and informative video! 👍

Thank you for explaining how to troubleshoot with it.  I am going to try that (because my circuits rarely work first time). \nIt is obvious that the components you tested for your DIY version are not granular enough for the kind of work you mentioned.\nIn my mind, that just means you haven't found a better camera module yet with a DIY price tag.  If you could bring the DIY version under $250, then it would still be a good DIY win assuming getting better resolution.\nIt seems as if finding a module with DMA transfer and hardware DSP to handle the correlational computations would probably require an embedded MCU or PIC, so the price would much higher.\nYou kinda missed out for this video because tearing down the expensive camera could have shown what model components they use.

However, a disadvantage of having thermal vision instead of visible light vision is that high spatial resolution in microscopy would be harder to achieve because microscopic objects that are smaller than half the wavelength of the light that the microscope detects cannot be resolved, i.e., seen distinctly, but will be seen as a blur. Infrared light has longer wavelengths than visible light.\n\nIn that case, we may need to conduct research into developing microscopes that can convert the then-invisible "visible light" into visible infrared light like how thermal cameras convert infrared light into visible light.

Couple of quick questions: (1) IR have three classification (near, mid and far), in order to develop IR stealth material/uniform which one of the classes shall be focused? Isn't it that if someone make far-IR stealth then it will cover both near and mid IR stealth as well? \r\n(2) Which of these three classes (Near, mid and far IR) are used by military for detecting enemies?

I'd definitely pick up this model if I wanted a handheld unit. Excellent price for the resolution, and UNI-T makes solid products. The temperature switching delay sure is a drawback. I assume it's recalibrating to ensure high accuracy. It's too bad you can't record video directly.\n\nOne thing not covered was the USB functionality. From what I understand, it appears as a normal USB camera so you can use any PC program to view/record it, or even hook it to a smartphone as many of those support USB cameras. So you could record video on the go with a smartphone, and view things on a larger screen.

I personally just purchased the UTi260E with the UT-Z003 macro lens, very excited to receive it!\n\nAlso note that the UTi-320E has a resolution of 320*240

I see there are macro lenses available for the thermal imaging part. For the money it's very good.

I ordered the uni-t uti260b from china and is currently on the way now. Can't wait to test it out.

I have tried their own software as well as obs. Windows 10 basically says the device is unrecognized. I really think you should have covered this functionality, recording video and what the software can do.

I have used the dual camera system and when set up properly it's a must for me ! and again that is if the software and optics are up to it, demonstrating this on the Arduino or some other board would have been nice too as I feel that you skipped the main reason for buying this model (second perhaps to the resolution) Even with my little winge still a great review...cheers.

A NETD of 150 mK means it will be able to detect a 0.27°F difference in temperature.

I can think of alot of uses for it in my trade. Just for tracing  malfunctioning parts it would be an awesome diagnostic tool

I had been eyeballing these for looking for wildlife (or sasquatch!) at night in the woods. I wasn't sure the range would be far enough to be useful though. Looked like you were getting pretty outdoor range with it though. Now I want one for sure :>

You should try viewing the drain pipes under a sink with hot and cold water , it looks pretty neat . \nAlso pouring hot water into the toilet or a bucket looks pretty nifty as well.. Good video , I am glad someone is as excited about it as I am ..:) Hopefully one day I'll be able to get the one with the high frame rate .

My engineering and physics teachers have used your videos in class many times to explain stuff.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I've loved your videos ever since I found your electric guitar video a couple years back.  Thank you for all the educational, and hilarious, moments!\n\nAlso the thermal sensor is awesome!  I'm applying for University soon, hoping to get into the ECE course there, do you have any tips regarding classes?
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   you read my mind with your heat seeing devices. I have been thinking of getting one to find out where the insulation has collapsed in my old home to minimize damage to the walls when I try and re insulate this summer (Winnipeg so no go in the winter). great looking product and as always, you make it fun and entertaining.

Between the literal drill holes in my walls to debugging overloaded power supply circuits. I've always wanted this tools in my workshop, but could never afford one on a college budget :/ Awesome Video!

Love your videos! I'd love to see more applications of cool electrical thingamajigs like this! I really like what Thomas Kim and Ludic Science do but you're much more entetaining :3
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               I've been having an issue with one room in the house being 10 degrees cooler when the door is shut in the window. I wasn't sure if the windows are leaking so this would be a good way to find where the air is going.

I would have appreciated this more than any other human on earth.

I could use this to monitor heat output on the circuit boards I design as an EE student. Plus all of the other cool uses showed in the video.

I was thinking about how to convert heat loss to energy loss (GJ). Do you have any ideas? I was thinking about estimating the U-value of my house by using thermal imaging and also working on the Plank Law. Any thoughts on this? Thanks!

Like your video so much👍 I used to have an issue with heat loss in my home. Then, I bought Infiray T2S+ thermal camera. I think that it's also a great device to find all the heat loss points in the house. The imaging is quite good for such an affordable price.

Then tighten up that level (from what I could tell the span was ok). Finally never, ever, ever say you’re looking at the temperature since this type of thermography is only qualitative. I could go into the multiple reasons for this but unless you’re using some thermocouples and or thermistors (ideally) don’t mention anything about temps. Just my 0.02$.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 To record video with this camera I use OBS instead of the Windows camera app and it works great, although framerate drops. Also, using an OTG cable you can also record using smarthphone, so you can record on the fly. The resulting video is only what is shown on screen, no data or visible image. My camera firmware is v1.1.2
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I've got an old and formerly very expensive FLIR i7. It doesn't do a lot but what it does it does great. What really stinks about it though is the support and the software. I think the software is what makes or breaks such a camera, the display is nice to get information on a glance, ensure the correct settings and make sure you capture everything you want to capture but where those cameras really shine is the after-the-fact image analysis (or "report generation") and that is where FLIR really sucks. The free FLIR Tools have been last updated 2014,only  a few months after I bought the camera... They're slow, they lousy, effectively abandonware and this camera doesn't have the required firmware to do live capture so you have to go through a rather time consuming shoot/analyze cycle...\n\nI'd really love to hear how good or bad the UNI-T software is... whatever my next thermal camera will be, it's definitely not going to be from FLIR.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      It really depends on the use. For the typical homeowner, someone who just needs a toolbox camera, or maybe for some computer troubleshooting, these cheep little cameras do the trick just fine. When serious thermal analysis needs to be done in a professional setting or when you NEED to know the temperature of a something, I'd buy a FLIR. They cost alot more but...well let's just say that you get what you pay for.

It seems many people have serious doubts about that spec

I love it, great for electronic work and such bang for the buck when you consider the thermal resolution.

Also, a tip, you could buy cheap macro lens (used in CO2 laser) and you get macro focus point. That  FLIR is no competitor

Still working well, and I think they do some higher resolution models now.

In your video you say that it's only possible to capture video in the provided software.  But I use my UTi260B in OBS without problems to capture the thermal video stream.   (however it only works with direct cable to my PC, not via USB3 hub).

It was out of stock for many months. Looking forward to finding all the hot spots around my house. Thanks for all you videos.

It would be interesting to buy this one and compare it with the TG267.

I want to use it mostly for heat loss of my house, pluming, electrical fuses, etc.

What a terrific way to start a Saturday!!
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Just to clarify, the 260B has a measuring range of -20C to 550C, they simply made a mistake on the packaging, new packaging is corrected. Very nice review btw! I will be recieving the 260E tomorrow, I can"t wait to try it out.

It was a great product. I believe I bought it for about $9,000. It had a fusion system where thermal was fused with visible. I used it to inspect motor control centers, high power connections, fuses etc.  It was purchased to replace an old, $50,000 FLIR camera.

You need to spend a lot more to reach the features and often even the quality of an UNI-T with renowned established brand. I use one of their multimeters for more than 6 years and I am very very happy with it, it was a steal compared to the big name brand F__K_ what were you all thinking!? 😄

Thanks so much.

I'm not a fan of non-replaceable batteries. I'm assuming you can replace it if it's a 26650. Thanks for your help!

I would expect the FOV of the newer camera to be 5/3 more....(50deg / 30 deg)  Do you have any explanation for this?  it seems like manufacturers specs are often not reliable and is most likely the case here. \n\nGreat video thank you for sharing.

I’m just dipping into thermal and I’ve been following T2 Pro since 2022. This review is what I needed to see. Thank you!

                                                                                     Superb review. Thank you.\n\nLooks like a great value gadget for those wanting to explore the pros and cons of thermal imaging before emptying the wallet/purse on a device that has top-of-the-range characteristics.\n\nWhile I have an expensive Hik unit that is clearly not in the same league, if I was limited to sub-12ftlb shooting or just watching nature in the garden, I'd be very tempted to give it a try, especially given that you can record sound too.\n\nThis reminds me very much of my first home-built IR system and the biggest drawback with that set-up was the notable battery drain, which rendered my phone dead pretty quickly - maybe the current draw of this device isn't the same though? With that said, I wonder if there is a missed opportunity to incorporate a a 2x 18650 battery holder in the handgrip (along with a suitable voltage regulator). So, plug the thermal unit into the handle directly and then use the cable to connect the handle to the phone perhaps? Doubt it would cost much more to produce and would allow the user to add their own batteries for improved longevity if it's important to them.

I do feel you have given that to us. It seems to be a great product, and reasonably priced as well. Thank you, and cheers from Texas.

I would like to know if I could use it for circuit repair to find hotspots on a circuit board that could be a possible fault. I have an old one and I would like to replace it plus use it for hunting so it's a double win for me if it's possible.

I love the footage on the rats, but I would be using this on rabbits and hares out to 100+ and Coyotes at further distances for spotting.

I have been a certified thermographer for about 15 years and use a high end FLIR for inspections of electrical gear. Good explanation of reflectivity, emissivity and transmittance. Most casual users don’t know about these pitfalls of infrared thermography. Hollywood doesn’t help… When people see a movie and cops are using IR to see through buildings to locate bad guys, I have to explain that’s not possible. What you demonstrated with tinfoil is a great demo of emissivity and reflectivity. Tinfoil does serve a purpose in thermography while in the field. When using infrared on a items with high emissivity, I will use a piece of tinfoil to measure background temperature. Wad up the foil and unfold it multiple times so the surface is full of micro wrinkles. Point the dull side toward the area you need a reflected temperature then point the IR camera at the tinfoil. The dull finish and micro wrinkles provides a good average temperature of the area it’s pointing. I can enter the reflected temperature into the reporting software to obtain an accurate component temp. Obviously you want to shoot at an angle so your body temp is not included in the average temp seen in the reflection of the foil.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  I was really impressed with your ability to follow a fully loaded circuit through the wall/drywall. For those times when you have no idea where a wire is routed...

I obviously had a lot more exploring to do . I was particularly impressed with the see-thru garbage bag and the temperature difference you see in the Boot-prints while walking through the snow.

They pay you pennies on the dollar compared to "real" advertising, yet your video is very effective at making me want to buy one of these.\nIt looks very fun, but also useful. My favorites were the stud finder and wire tracer.

I really enjoyed the examples of infrared interactions at the end. I love that you included the ffmpeg command. The dual camera setup is great too! I hope these thermal cameras keep coming down in price.

I never knew such an alternative world existed but now that I do, I want one of those! As a carpenter, what an excellent way to find studs, cables, pipes and so on, anywhere in a building - but it's also a fun and unique eye-opener in everyday life.

The deeper snow is warmer, the electrical wires in the walls, the office chair!! Thank you!

It was really neat to see so much IR video all at once like that.  You just get so used to seeing the world in visible light that its always a bit startling to see the world differently like this.  Maybe TOPDON will release a UV camera one day and you can build a triple mount.

Fun fact, few years ago the cheap FLIR ones were only 9hz because of US export restrictions on IR cameras. Now the cheap chinese ones can give you glorious 25FPS / Hz IR!

The emissivity of different materials and surface finishes is fascinating too, so I would be keen to see how you tackle that subject Matthias. Thank you, always learning with you.

Thanks Jeff. I having insulation issue all over the house. I am noticed it a lot this morning because it’s 50 outside. Btw, loved the investigation done in that Miami condo.

I plan on air sealing in my attic, high hats/fixtures, fans, and outlets.

I own a few Klein Tools and have been happy with them. I appreciate you taking the time to show how to read and interpret your findings.

I think this will work well for that.

If you could do a review on it, it would be awesome. I want to see how it compares in video quality to the HF one or similar.

Doing RF work right now and working on my MSEE in antenna and microwave engineering.\n\nAnyway, no wonder I liked your channel right away. Must have been my EE-dar detecting a fellow EE haha

I got it to check my electric panel and electric outlets. Paranoid over too much electrical stuff. 😁

It really amazed me because it supports secondary analysis of the temperature data in the thermal images. And I can connect it directly to the smartphone for plug-and-play accurate temperature measurement. Very convenient!

It's in fact the outlet itself. The visible and infrared images don't always align. There may be a setting to help adjust.

I use several Flir products, E96 backed up with a Protimeter moisture meters MMS3. I like the built in hydrometer. Nice video uncovering many issues-we never have enough tools in the moisture and thermal imaging inspection business. Thank for the video

I appreciated your video.  Thanks for posting.

Before such an investment I want to make sure the tech actually works. This video was super informative and I feel much better about spending that much money on a tool I’m going to be using daily. Thanks!

It seems it will suit me perfectly!

What do I have to consider when entering the measurement parameters? Can I leave the default settings as they are or do I have to change them (e.g. emissivity)?

Would this work looking for hot air coming in?

All of the product review I each so far are bad. They show the product but they don't walk around showing it like the way you did. \nI will be buying one soon and be a video about it soon. I see fun things with it and also to check where the cold air in coming in from my home to so I can fix the problem. Great video. I enjoy it. Thanks.

So I bought Infiray T2 Pro thermal monocular as a birthday gift for him. It's cost-effective and my son loves it so much.

I wish I had a camera like this. it'd make for cool scenery photos
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           You said the HTI HT-191 at the end with a sensor of 320x240 was "easily the highest of any on the list" but your #3 seek reveal pro has the same resolution. As a general rule, I don't trust any research that's done based on  "reading customer reviews". This almost always means just seeing what has the highest Amazon ratings. Does anyone seriously trust Amazon reviews anymore?
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Looks like sponsored ad. Why not mention Infiray devices? I have Infiray T2L attached to my phone via USB-C and it rocks! Manual focus is so great and 25 fps @ 288x192 thermal sensor makes it number one. Alu body, top quality for the price 1/3 of seek thermal reveal pro... Why havent you done deeper research on the market? All these shitty videos about "top super hiper best" are just shitty and showing no respect to us - Viewers. Channel banned. And this is mine, not sponsored opinion.

Like finding leaks in the insulation of your house in winter.  Or finding where your cat is hiding in your bedroom.

This made a thermal camera well worth it for me.

That way you could set something down in front of it and depending on the size and how far away it was, you could adjust the parameters to measure the X, Y of where the hot pixels are and know very accurately where the component is. It just wouldn't be a handy handheld tool for quick observations.

Not an easy task to beat manufacturers in having great products!

They are very affordable IR modules with a USB interface, but it's all proprietary. I think they managed to crack the older models but the newer models only produce a raw unprocessed image last time I looked into it.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 One thing the commercial camera does that the DIY version does not is overlay the thermal image, which has a fairly low resolution, over a very basic black and white visible image. It gives a lot better view into what's actually going on. If you were to add that to the DIY project, and say, replace the ESP32 with a Raspberry Pi Zero and camera module to add the visible image display, this project can be a lot better.

I feel like just a few days ago I was thinking about this exact same problem.

Thanks a lot! 😃\nEven though it didn't work out, it's a fantastic starting point! I bet we're going to see a fully functional IR camera pretty soon! 😃\nAnyway, stay safe and creative there! 🖖😊

It does a good job. I've used it to find thermal "leak" around the house, monitored wheel bearing temps on my travel trailer as well as using it for monitoring my electronic circuits.

Huge value, and you can Google it easily.

The resolution is about half way between your DIY and the FLIR; I've used it now and then for troubleshooting and/or augmenting my videos with stills - as it cannot record video. But then, the price was also half way between your options: about 250$ IIRC.

But anyways, this was a good and informative video! 👍

Thank you for explaining how to troubleshoot with it.  I am going to try that (because my circuits rarely work first time). \nIt is obvious that the components you tested for your DIY version are not granular enough for the kind of work you mentioned.\nIn my mind, that just means you haven't found a better camera module yet with a DIY price tag.  If you could bring the DIY version under $250, then it would still be a good DIY win assuming getting better resolution.\nIt seems as if finding a module with DMA transfer and hardware DSP to handle the correlational computations would probably require an embedded MCU or PIC, so the price would much higher.\nYou kinda missed out for this video because tearing down the expensive camera could have shown what model components they use.

However, a disadvantage of having thermal vision instead of visible light vision is that high spatial resolution in microscopy would be harder to achieve because microscopic objects that are smaller than half the wavelength of the light that the microscope detects cannot be resolved, i.e., seen distinctly, but will be seen as a blur. Infrared light has longer wavelengths than visible light.\n\nIn that case, we may need to conduct research into developing microscopes that can convert the then-invisible "visible light" into visible infrared light like how thermal cameras convert infrared light into visible light.

Couple of quick questions: (1) IR have three classification (near, mid and far), in order to develop IR stealth material/uniform which one of the classes shall be focused? Isn't it that if someone make far-IR stealth then it will cover both near and mid IR stealth as well? \r\n(2) Which of these three classes (Near, mid and far IR) are used by military for detecting enemies?

I'd definitely pick up this model if I wanted a handheld unit. Excellent price for the resolution, and UNI-T makes solid products. The temperature switching delay sure is a drawback. I assume it's recalibrating to ensure high accuracy. It's too bad you can't record video directly.\n\nOne thing not covered was the USB functionality. From what I understand, it appears as a normal USB camera so you can use any PC program to view/record it, or even hook it to a smartphone as many of those support USB cameras. So you could record video on the go with a smartphone, and view things on a larger screen.

I personally just purchased the UTi260E with the UT-Z003 macro lens, very excited to receive it!\n\nAlso note that the UTi-320E has a resolution of 320*240

I see there are macro lenses available for the thermal imaging part. For the money it's very good.

I ordered the uni-t uti260b from china and is currently on the way now. Can't wait to test it out.

I have tried their own software as well as obs. Windows 10 basically says the device is unrecognized. I really think you should have covered this functionality, recording video and what the software can do.

I have used the dual camera system and when set up properly it's a must for me ! and again that is if the software and optics are up to it, demonstrating this on the Arduino or some other board would have been nice too as I feel that you skipped the main reason for buying this model (second perhaps to the resolution) Even with my little winge still a great review...cheers.

A NETD of 150 mK means it will be able to detect a 0.27°F difference in temperature.

I can think of alot of uses for it in my trade. Just for tracing  malfunctioning parts it would be an awesome diagnostic tool

I had been eyeballing these for looking for wildlife (or sasquatch!) at night in the woods. I wasn't sure the range would be far enough to be useful though. Looked like you were getting pretty outdoor range with it though. Now I want one for sure :>

You should try viewing the drain pipes under a sink with hot and cold water , it looks pretty neat . \nAlso pouring hot water into the toilet or a bucket looks pretty nifty as well.. Good video , I am glad someone is as excited about it as I am ..:) Hopefully one day I'll be able to get the one with the high frame rate .

My engineering and physics teachers have used your videos in class many times to explain stuff.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                I've loved your videos ever since I found your electric guitar video a couple years back.  Thank you for all the educational, and hilarious, moments!\n\nAlso the thermal sensor is awesome!  I'm applying for University soon, hoping to get into the ECE course there, do you have any tips regarding classes?

I have been thinking of getting one to find out where the insulation has collapsed in my old home to minimize damage to the walls when I try and re insulate this summer (Winnipeg so no go in the winter). great looking product and as always, you make it fun and entertaining.

Between the literal drill holes in my walls to debugging overloaded power supply circuits. I've always wanted this tools in my workshop, but could never afford one on a college budget :/ Awesome Video!

Love your videos! I'd love to see more applications of cool electrical thingamajigs like this! I really like what Thomas Kim and Ludic Science do but you're much more entetaining :3
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I've been having an issue with one room in the house being 10 degrees cooler when the door is shut in the window. I wasn't sure if the windows are leaking so this would be a good way to find where the air is going.

I would have appreciated this more than any other human on earth.

I could use this to monitor heat output on the circuit boards I design as an EE student. Plus all of the other cool uses showed in the video.

I was thinking about how to convert heat loss to energy loss (GJ). Do you have any ideas? I was thinking about estimating the U-value of my house by using thermal imaging and also working on the Plank Law. Any thoughts on this? Thanks!

Like your video so much👍 I used to have an issue with heat loss in my home. Then, I bought Infiray T2S+ thermal camera. I think that it's also a great device to find all the heat loss points in the house. The imaging is quite good for such an affordable price.

Then tighten up that level (from what I could tell the span was ok). Finally never, ever, ever say you’re looking at the temperature since this type of thermography is only qualitative. I could go into the multiple reasons for this but unless you’re using some thermocouples and or thermistors (ideally) don’t mention anything about temps. Just my 0.02$.

Very nice review btw! I will be recieving the 260E tomorrow, I can"t wait to try it out.

It was a great product. I believe I bought it for about $9,000. It had a fusion system where thermal was fused with visible. I used it to inspect motor control centers, high power connections, fuses etc.  It was purchased to replace an old, $50,000 FLIR camera.

You need to spend a lot more to reach the features and often even the quality of an UNI-T with renowned established brand. I use one of their multimeters for more than 6 years and I am very very happy with it, it was a steal compared to the big name brand F__K_ what were you all thinking!? 😄

Thanks so much.

I'm not a fan of non-replaceable batteries. I'm assuming you can replace it if it's a 26650. Thanks for your help!

I would expect the FOV of the newer camera to be 5/3 more....(50deg / 30 deg)  Do you have any explanation for this?  it seems like manufacturers specs are often not reliable and is most likely the case here. \n\nGreat video thank you for sharing.

Especially seeing that one of the meters was inaccurate by almost 10 degrees.

The cheaper FLIRs have come a long way. I think you just made a sale

Can you please recommend a cheap thermal camera for detecting short on pc motherboards? Looking for something cheap but that will do the job. Thanks In advance and happy new year!

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              I've got an old and formerly very expensive FLIR i7. It doesn't do a lot but what it does it does great. What really stinks about it though is the support and the software. I think the software is what makes or breaks such a camera, the display is nice to get information on a glance, ensure the correct settings and make sure you capture everything you want to capture but where those cameras really shine is the after-the-fact image analysis (or "report generation") and that is where FLIR really sucks. The free FLIR Tools have been last updated 2014,only  a few months after I bought the camera... They're slow, they lousy, effectively abandonware and this camera doesn't have the required firmware to do live capture so you have to go through a rather time consuming shoot/analyze cycle...\n\nI'd really love to hear how good or bad the UNI-T software is... whatever my next thermal camera will be, it's definitely not going to be from FLIR.

Also, using an OTG cable you can also record using smarthphone, so you can record on the fly. The resulting video is only what is shown on screen, no data or visible image. My camera firmware is v1.1.2

I love it, great for electronic work and such bang for the buck when you consider the thermal resolution.

For the typical homeowner, someone who just needs a toolbox camera, or maybe for some computer troubleshooting, these cheep little cameras do the trick just fine. When serious thermal analysis needs to be done in a professional setting or when you NEED to know the temperature of a something, I'd buy a FLIR. They cost alot more but...well let's just say that you get what you pay for.

It seems many people have serious doubts about that spec

Still working well, and I think they do some higher resolution models now.

In your video you say that it's only possible to capture video in the provided software.  But I use my UTi260B in OBS without problems to capture the thermal video stream.   (however it only works with direct cable to my PC, not via USB3 hub).

Also, a tip, you could buy cheap macro lens (used in CO2 laser) and you get macro focus point. That  FLIR is no competitor

I want to use it mostly for heat loss of my house, pluming, electrical fuses, etc.

I’m just dipping into thermal and I’ve been following T2 Pro since 2022. This review is what I needed to see. Thank you!
                                                                                                                Superb review. Thank you.\n\nLooks like a great value gadget for those wanting to explore the pros and cons of thermal imaging before emptying the wallet/purse on a device that has top-of-the-range characteristics.\n\nWhile I have an expensive Hik unit that is clearly not in the same league, if I was limited to sub-12ftlb shooting or just watching nature in the garden, I'd be very tempted to give it a try, especially given that you can record sound too.\n\nThis reminds me very much of my first home-built IR system and the biggest drawback with that set-up was the notable battery drain, which rendered my phone dead pretty quickly - maybe the current draw of this device isn't the same though? With that said, I wonder if there is a missed opportunity to incorporate a a 2x 18650 battery holder in the handgrip (along with a suitable voltage regulator). So, plug the thermal unit into the handle directly and then use the cable to connect the handle to the phone perhaps? Doubt it would cost much more to produce and would allow the user to add their own batteries for improved longevity if it's important to them.

I've been looking at this one and the size of the unit and quality of the view is amazing. Thank you for doing this video I love the no BS review. Cheers brother

I was looking at hand held monoculars today with a view to buying one but I think I’m gonna go for this & save quite a bit money. Cheers buddy 👍🇬🇧

But nice review thank you.

I love the footage on the rats, but I would be using this on rabbits and hares out to 100+ and Coyotes at further distances for spotting.

Like the less hunting oriented units? Be great for my business for pest control, not just hunting but also locating wasps nests too
Good morning Steve from Suffolk UK. I think your channel is one of the best informative channels in the UK. Others claim it but you do it? As for the new thermal your putting through its paces I have a thermal a 19 mm thermal handheld bit like the hike version but the problem with that is when you look through that thermal you see the rats in the brambles or bushes and then you pick up your rifle and look through the scope with infrared and you can't figure out whereabouts they were. So my idea is to get one of those little things and mount it on the side of the rifle, on a little picatinny mount and  the  camera  with a USB cable come back to the smallest mobile i phone I can find on the market to come close to the diopter on my night vision scope so I can quickly reference between what I'm looking at through the thermal and where the cross hairs on the night side are because I found this is a common problem  that I face when I'm out night shooting 99% of the time. I don't know what you think, but I think that's a brilliant idea if I make a really small bracket for this really small camera and it would not increase the weight of the rifle hardly at all. What are your thoughts on this please? Your loyal follower?

                           I have been a certified thermographer for about 15 years and use a high end FLIR for inspections of electrical gear. Good explanation of reflectivity, emissivity and transmittance. Most casual users don’t know about these pitfalls of infrared thermography. Hollywood doesn’t help… When people see a movie and cops are using IR to see through buildings to locate bad guys, I have to explain that’s not possible. What you demonstrated with tinfoil is a great demo of emissivity and reflectivity. Tinfoil does serve a purpose in thermography while in the field. When using infrared on a items with high emissivity, I will use a piece of tinfoil to measure background temperature. Wad up the foil and unfold it multiple times so the surface is full of micro wrinkles. Point the dull side toward the area you need a reflected temperature then point the IR camera at the tinfoil. The dull finish and micro wrinkles provides a good average temperature of the area it’s pointing. I can enter the reflected temperature into the reporting software to obtain an accurate component temp. Obviously you want to shoot at an angle so your body temp is not included in the average temp seen in the reflection of the foil.

For those times when you have no idea where a wire is routed...

I obviously had a lot more exploring to do . I was particularly impressed with the see-thru garbage bag and the temperature difference you see in the Boot-prints while walking through the snow.

They pay you pennies on the dollar compared to "real" advertising, yet your video is very effective at making me want to buy one of these.\nIt looks very fun, but also useful. My favorites were the stud finder and wire tracer.

I really enjoyed the examples of infrared interactions at the end. I love that you included the ffmpeg command. The dual camera setup is great too! I hope these thermal cameras keep coming down in price.

I never knew such an alternative world existed but now that I do, I want one of those! As a carpenter, what an excellent way to find studs, cables, pipes and so on, anywhere in a building - but it's also a fun and unique eye-opener in everyday life.

The deeper snow is warmer, the electrical wires in the walls, the office chair!! Thank you!

Looks exactly like some art you'd see at some nerd convention us viewers might attend

It was really neat to see so much IR video all at once like that.  You just get so used to seeing the world in visible light that its always a bit startling to see the world differently like this.  Maybe TOPDON will release a UV camera one day and you can build a triple mount.

Fun fact, few years ago the cheap FLIR ones were only 9hz because of US export restrictions on IR cameras. Now the cheap chinese ones can give you glorious 25FPS / Hz IR!

The emissivity of different materials and surface finishes is fascinating too, so I would be keen to see how you tackle that subject Matthias. Thank you, always learning with you.

I think this will work well for that.

If you could do a review on it, it would be awesome. I want to see how it compares in video quality to the HF one or similar.

Doing RF work right now and working on my MSEE in antenna and microwave engineering.\n\nAnyway, no wonder I liked your channel right away. Must have been my EE-dar detecting a fellow EE haha

It's not a review of any of the devices, it's just to show what a TI camera can do (which we all know).  It's just an advertisement for the cameras,  What a shame.  It could have been very useful but it was just a misrepresentation.

It really amazed me because it supports secondary analysis of the temperature data in the thermal images. And I can connect it directly to the smartphone for plug-and-play accurate temperature measurement. Very convenient!

It's in fact the outlet itself. The visible and infrared images don't always align. There may be a setting to help adjust.

I use several Flir products, E96 backed up with a Protimeter moisture meters MMS3. I like the built in hydrometer. Nice video uncovering many issues-we never have enough tools in the moisture and thermal imaging inspection business. Thank for the video

Before such an investment I want to make sure the tech actually works. This video was super informative and I feel much better about spending that much money on a tool I’m going to be using daily.

It seems it will suit me perfectly!

What do I have to consider when entering the measurement parameters? Can I leave the default settings as they are or do I have to change them (e.g. emissivity)?

Thanks for the video.  Hey what model infrared camera are you using.

Would this work looking for hot air coming in?

All of the product review I each so far are bad. They show the product but they don't walk around showing it like the way you did. \nI will be buying one soon and be a video about it soon.

As a general rule, I don't trust any research that's done based on  "reading customer reviews". This almost always means just seeing what has the highest Amazon ratings. Does anyone seriously trust Amazon reviews anymore?

Why not mention Infiray devices? I have Infiray T2L attached to my phone via USB-C and it rocks! Manual focus is so great and 25 fps @ 288x192 thermal sensor makes it number one. Alu body, top quality for the price 1/3 of seek thermal reveal pro... Why havent you done deeper research on the market? All these shitty videos about "top super hiper best" are just shitty and showing no respect to us - Viewers. Channel banned. And this is mine, not sponsored opinion.

So I bought Infiray T2 Pro thermal monocular as a birthday gift for him. It's cost-effective and my son loves it so much.

In future reviews, could you please show the MAXIMUM usable distance and setting? It would help those of us interested in using it for finding energy leaks in buildings. Thank you.

I'd definitely pick up this model if I wanted a handheld unit. Excellent price for the resolution, and UNI-T makes solid products. The temperature switching delay sure is a drawback. I assume it's recalibrating to ensure high accuracy. It's too bad you can't record video directly.\n\nOne thing not covered was the USB functionality. From what I understand, it appears as a normal USB camera so you can use any PC program to view/record it, or even hook it to a smartphone as many of those support USB cameras. So you could record video on the go with a smartphone, and view things on a larger screen.

I personally just purchased the UTi260E with the UT-Z003 macro lens, very excited to receive it!\n\nAlso note that the UTi-320E has a resolution of 320*240

I see there are macro lenses available for the thermal imaging part. For the money it's very good.

I ordered the uni-t uti260b from china and is currently on the way now. Can't wait to test it out.

I have tried their own software as well as obs. Windows 10 basically says the device is unrecognized. I really think you should have covered this functionality, recording video and what the software can do.

I have used the dual camera system and when set up properly it's a must for me ! and again that is if the software and optics are up to it, demonstrating this on the Arduino or some other board would have been nice too as I feel that you skipped the main reason for buying this model (second perhaps to the resolution) Even with my little winge still a great review...cheers.

A NETD of 150 mK means it will be able to detect a 0.27°F difference in temperature.

I need something to see beehives inside walls. They give off a good deal of heat.

Cool but seems over priced.

However, a disadvantage of having thermal vision instead of visible light vision is that high spatial resolution in microscopy would be harder to achieve because microscopic objects that are smaller than half the wavelength of the light that the microscope detects cannot be resolved, i.e., seen distinctly, but will be seen as a blur. Infrared light has longer wavelengths than visible light.\n\nIn that case, we may need to conduct research into developing microscopes that can convert the then-invisible "visible light" into visible infrared light like how thermal cameras convert infrared light into visible light.

Couple of quick questions: (1) IR have three classification (near, mid and far), in order to develop IR stealth material/uniform which one of the classes shall be focused? Isn't it that if someone make far-IR stealth then it will cover both near and mid IR stealth as well? \r\n(2) Which of these three classes (Near, mid and far IR) are used by military for detecting enemies?

Nuclear radiation is electromagnetic radiation too. Infrared is low energy radiation, even lower than visible light which is also em radiation. While nuclear ones like xray is high energy radiation. \nOther one is that infrared doesn't come after red, its before it. Red follows rest of the colours since its the longest wavelength and least energy, all other colours are higher energy and come after it. Before it lies even lower energy waves like infrared and microwaves.

This made a thermal camera well worth it for me.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  You could calibrate the DIY camera for use at a set distance and use it stationary. That way you could set something down in front of it and depending on the size and how far away it was, you could adjust the parameters to measure the X, Y of where the hot pixels are and know very accurately where the component is. It just wouldn't be a handy handheld tool for quick observations.

Not an easy task to beat manufacturers in having great products!
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     One option you didn't explore was the hacking that was done with the SEEK thermal imaging cameras. They are very affordable IR modules with a USB interface, but it's all proprietary. I think they managed to crack the older models but the newer models only produce a raw unprocessed image last time I looked into it.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            One thing the commercial camera does that the DIY version does not is overlay the thermal image, which has a fairly low resolution, over a very basic black and white visible image. It gives a lot better view into what's actually going on. If you were to add that to the DIY project, and say, replace the ESP32 with a Raspberry Pi Zero and camera module to add the visible image display, this project can be a lot better.

I feel like just a few days ago I was thinking about this exact same problem.

Thanks a lot! 😃\nEven though it didn't work out, it's a fantastic starting point! I bet we're going to see a fully functional IR camera pretty soon! 😃\nAnyway, stay safe and creative there! 🖖😊

It does a good job. I've used it to find thermal "leak" around the house, monitored wheel bearing temps on my travel trailer as well as using it for monitoring my electronic circuits.

Huge value, and you can Google it easily.

The resolution is about half way between your DIY and the FLIR; I've used it now and then for troubleshooting and/or augmenting my videos with stills - as it cannot record video. But then, the price was also half way between your options: about 250$ IIRC.

But anyways, this was a good and informative video! 👍

Thank you for explaining how to troubleshoot with it.  I am going to try that (because my circuits rarely work first time). \nIt is obvious that the components you tested for your DIY version are not granular enough for the kind of work you mentioned.\nIn my mind, that just means you haven't found a better camera module yet with a DIY price tag.  If you could bring the DIY version under $250, then it would still be a good DIY win assuming getting better resolution.\nIt seems as if finding a module with DMA transfer and hardware DSP to handle the correlational computations would probably require an embedded MCU or PIC, so the price would much higher.\nYou kinda missed out for this video because tearing down the expensive camera could have shown what model components they use.
