During the cold winter here in Norway I checked all the temp. losses from outside, but the most important one was when I checked all the junction boxes in the house, I did find one were the connectors where going bad and I did fix that, no fire here!  At work I can use my Cat S62Pro to check conveyer belt motors, and electric stuff that I work with. Really usefull phone!

It has better resolution (320x240). And I use 3 different Co2 laser focusing lens (ZnSe) for closeup shots. The only issue I have it is annoying slow 9hz update rate. And stupid network connectivity to download picture of course.

It's all about the looks and zero about the function unless you build it yourself or manage the build.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I need to see someone use it for circuit board repair to see if it sees small capacitors.
                                                                                                                                                             What I like most about this is the fact you don't need a phone or computer to use it. On the down side, when the battery fails I wonder how difficult it would be to replace. Also with a fixed focus, I wonder how close it can focus. The real benefit for me would be analysis of circuit boards. Do you think this will focus closely enough to isolate transistors, capacitors, etc?
                                       Excellent video presentation,  review and comparison.\nHaving studied the specifications of various units, the\nUNI-T UNI690b  is above average for the price.\nPerhaps not perfect, however at this price it surpasses\nsome more expensive units.\nFor anyone looking for a less expensive unit,  I would sa\ndon't waste your $$$ --  One will be happier in the long term\nto invest a little more and buy the UNI-T UNI690b.\nIT wasn't so long ago that units with these specifications\nwould cost $1400
                                                                                                                                                                                                          The UTI690B thermal camera (basically the same as video) stopped working after charging it the first time. I was charging it with a wall adapter (only a USB cable is included) and it just doesn't turn on anymore. It's a fantastic camera, and I really enjoyed using it. I expect it's just a bad battery or hopefully just a bad batch.

                                     I've actually wanted to try going about my business with thermal vision only, to see how well I'd cope, not to mention just to see the patterns of color from hot and cold sources.\n\nToo bad Thermal cameras (to say nothing of googles) are ummm, not cheap.  Who knows, maybe 10 or 15 years from now people could get such things the size of sunglasses and reasonably priced.  Technology marches on after all.\n\nOne could use IR instead though, maybe?  Wouldn't look as psychedelic though, I expect.

In thermal vision how is it you can see the outline of the reflection when the surface should be cold?

And I’m always wondering about different what if’s about sound here’s my idea, what if we had digital hearing? Or what if we had supersonic hearing and rather than hear somebody in the next room, you could hear people from another Country or even another state.

Think about it. Thermal has a lot of positives but in this case it has more negatives. Yes you can see heat but you only see heat. Developments like mobile devices would become impossible as the screen would be one colour. So would other technological developments. Determination of basic materials would be very hard. Construction of new items very hard. If we suddenly got thermal vision then survival could be a lot easier but it's a double edged sword with humans. But making new things would become very much close to impossible.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  I am using flir e4 with hacked FW to e8 specs. It has better resolution (320x240). And I use 3 different Co2 laser focusing lens (ZnSe) for closeup shots. The only issue I have it is annoying slow 9hz update rate. And stupid network connectivity to download picture of course.
                                                                                                                                                             What I like most about this is the fact you don't need a phone or computer to use it. On the down side, when the battery fails I wonder how difficult it would be to replace. Also with a fixed focus, I wonder how close it can focus. The real benefit for me would be analysis of circuit boards. Do you think this will focus closely enough to isolate transistors, capacitors, etc?
                                       Excellent video presentation,  review and comparison.\nHaving studied the specifications of various units, the\nUNI-T UNI690b  is above average for the price.\nPerhaps not perfect, however at this price it surpasses\nsome more expensive units.\nFor anyone looking for a less expensive unit,  I would sa\ndon't waste your $$$ --  One will be happier in the long term\nto invest a little more and buy the UNI-T UNI690b.\nIT wasn't so long ago that units with these specifications\nwould cost $1400
                                                                                                                                                                                                          The UTI690B thermal camera (basically the same as video) stopped working after charging it the first time. I was charging it with a wall adapter (only a USB cable is included) and it just doesn't turn on anymore. It's a fantastic camera, and I really enjoyed using it. I expect it's just a bad battery or hopefully just a bad batch.

During the cold winter here in Norway I checked all the temp. losses from outside, but the most important one was when I checked all the junction boxes in the house, I did find one were the connectors where going bad and I did fix that, no fire here!  At work I can use my Cat S62Pro to check conveyer belt motors, and electric stuff that I work with. Really usefull phone!

It's all about the looks and zero about the function unless you build it yourself or manage the build.

What you want to do is rapidly change the temperature in the environment if you want to 'see' water.   Home inspectors who use these undergo training and certification so they don't go unnecessarily freaking out homebuyers about roof leaks...

                                     I've actually wanted to try going about my business with thermal vision only, to see how well I'd cope, not to mention just to see the patterns of color from hot and cold sources.\n\nToo bad Thermal cameras (to say nothing of googles) are ummm, not cheap.  Who knows, maybe 10 or 15 years from now people could get such things the size of sunglasses and reasonably priced.  Technology marches on after all.\n\nOne could use IR instead though, maybe?  Wouldn't look as psychedelic though, I expect.

I've been curious about it ever since I saw the film "Pitch Black."

In thermal vision how is it you can see the outline of the reflection when the surface should be cold?
                                                                                                                                                                                                              I have another idea for another what if video, I am totally blind. And I’m always wondering about different what if’s about sound here’s my idea, what if we had digital hearing? Or what if we had supersonic hearing and rather than hear somebody in the next room, you could hear people from another Country or even another state.

Think about it. Thermal has a lot of positives but in this case it has more negatives. Yes you can see heat but you only see heat. Developments like mobile devices would become impossible as the screen would be one colour. So would other technological developments. Determination of basic materials would be very hard. Construction of new items very hard. If we suddenly got thermal vision then survival could be a lot easier but it's a double edged sword with humans. But making new things would become very much close to impossible.

I’m looking for a thermal for coyote hunting but they are all crazy money                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         the ability to see things in the dark just by their temperature difference is probably the coolest thing I've seen in a while

Too bad about the price tag.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I did a review on one of these a few months ago, I like my one quite a lot.\nThe only trouble is I’m getting a lot of reports of them being out of stock and people are having to wait a long time to get them.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  I am using flir e4 with hacked FW to e8 specs. It has better resolution (320x240). And I use 3 different Co2 laser focusing lens (ZnSe) for closeup shots. The only issue I have it is annoying slow 9hz update rate. And stupid network connectivity to download picture of course.
                                                                                                                                                             What I like most about this is the fact you don't need a phone or computer to use it. On the down side, when the battery fails I wonder how difficult it would be to replace. Also with a fixed focus, I wonder how close it can focus. The real benefit for me would be analysis of circuit boards. Do you think this will focus closely enough to isolate transistors, capacitors, etc?
                                       Excellent video presentation,  review and comparison.\nHaving studied the specifications of various units, the\nUNI-T UNI690b  is above average for the price.\nPerhaps not perfect, however at this price it surpasses\nsome more expensive units.\nFor anyone looking for a less expensive unit,  I would sa\ndon't waste your $$$ --  One will be happier in the long term\nto invest a little more and buy the UNI-T UNI690b.\nIT wasn't so long ago that units with these specifications\nwould cost $1400
                                                                                                                                                                                                          The UTI690B thermal camera (basically the same as video) stopped working after charging it the first time. I was charging it with a wall adapter (only a USB cable is included) and it just doesn't turn on anymore. It's a fantastic camera, and I really enjoyed using it. I expect it's just a bad battery or hopefully just a bad batch.

During the cold winter here in Norway I checked all the temp. losses from outside, but the most important one was when I checked all the junction boxes in the house, I did find one were the connectors where going bad and I did fix that, no fire here!  At work I can use my Cat S62Pro to check conveyer belt motors, and electric stuff that I work with. Really usefull phone!

It's all about the looks and zero about the function unless you build it yourself or manage the build.

What you want to do is rapidly change the temperature in the environment if you want to 'see' water.   Home inspectors who use these undergo training and certification so they don't go unnecessarily freaking out homebuyers about roof leaks...

                                     I've actually wanted to try going about my business with thermal vision only, to see how well I'd cope, not to mention just to see the patterns of color from hot and cold sources.\n\nToo bad Thermal cameras (to say nothing of googles) are ummm, not cheap.  Who knows, maybe 10 or 15 years from now people could get such things the size of sunglasses and reasonably priced.  Technology marches on after all.\n\nOne could use IR instead though, maybe?  Wouldn't look as psychedelic though, I expect.

I've been curious about it ever since I saw the film "Pitch Black."

In thermal vision how is it you can see the outline of the reflection when the surface should be cold?
                                                                                                                                                                                                              I have another idea for another what if video, I am totally blind. And I’m always wondering about different what if’s about sound here’s my idea, what if we had digital hearing? Or what if we had supersonic hearing and rather than hear somebody in the next room, you could hear people from another Country or even another state.

Think about it. Thermal has a lot of positives but in this case it has more negatives. Yes you can see heat but you only see heat. Developments like mobile devices would become impossible as the screen would be one colour. So would other technological developments. Determination of basic materials would be very hard. Construction of new items very hard. If we suddenly got thermal vision then survival could be a lot easier but it's a double edged sword with humans. But making new things would become very much close to impossible.

I’m looking for a thermal for coyote hunting but they are all crazy money                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         the ability to see things in the dark just by their temperature difference is probably the coolest thing I've seen in a while

Too bad about the price tag.

                                                                                                                                                             What I like most about this is the fact you don't need a phone or computer to use it. On the down side, when the battery fails I wonder how difficult it would be to replace. Also with a fixed focus, I wonder how close it can focus. The real benefit for me would be analysis of circuit boards. Do you think this will focus closely enough to isolate transistors, capacitors, etc?
                                       Excellent video presentation,  review and comparison.\nHaving studied the specifications of various units, the\nUNI-T UNI690b  is above average for the price.\nPerhaps not perfect, however at this price it surpasses\nsome more expensive units.\nFor anyone looking for a less expensive unit,  I would sa\ndon't waste your $$$ --  One will be happier in the long term\nto invest a little more and buy the UNI-T UNI690b.\nIT wasn't so long ago that units with these specifications\nwould cost $1400
                                                                                                                                                                                                          The UTI690B thermal camera (basically the same as video) stopped working after charging it the first time. I was charging it with a wall adapter (only a USB cable is included) and it just doesn't turn on anymore. It's a fantastic camera, and I really enjoyed using it. I expect it's just a bad battery or hopefully just a bad batch.

It has better resolution (320x240). And I use 3 different Co2 laser focusing lens (ZnSe) for closeup shots. The only issue I have it is annoying slow 9hz update rate. And stupid network connectivity to download picture of course.

During the cold winter here in Norway I checked all the temp. losses from outside, but the most important one was when I checked all the junction boxes in the house, I did find one were the connectors where going bad and I did fix that, no fire here!  At work I can use my Cat S62Pro to check conveyer belt motors, and electric stuff that I work with. Really usefull phone!

                                     I've actually wanted to try going about my business with thermal vision only, to see how well I'd cope, not to mention just to see the patterns of color from hot and cold sources.\n\nToo bad Thermal cameras (to say nothing of googles) are ummm, not cheap.  Who knows, maybe 10 or 15 years from now people could get such things the size of sunglasses and reasonably priced.  Technology marches on after all.\n\nOne could use IR instead though, maybe?  Wouldn't look as psychedelic though, I expect.

In thermal vision how is it you can see the outline of the reflection when the surface should be cold?

And I’m always wondering about different what if’s about sound here’s my idea, what if we had digital hearing? Or what if we had supersonic hearing and rather than hear somebody in the next room, you could hear people from another Country or even another state.

A++ from me!
Think about it. Thermal has a lot of positives but in this case it has more negatives. Yes you can see heat but you only see heat. Developments like mobile devices would become impossible as the screen would be one colour. So would other technological developments. Determination of basic materials would be very hard. Construction of new items very hard. If we suddenly got thermal vision then survival could be a lot easier but it's a double edged sword with humans. But making new things would become very much close to impossible.
