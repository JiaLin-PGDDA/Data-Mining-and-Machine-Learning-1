1,"How can anyone not love this guy, he is hilarious and brilliant."
2,the ability to see things in the dark just by their temperature difference is probably the coolest thing I've seen in a while
3,"I'm an HVAC tech, I could really use this to help show customers where their heat loss is happening."
4,this would be a really useful tool for hvac technicians. I can think of alot of uses for it in my trade. Just for tracing  malfunctioning parts it would be an awesome diagnostic tool
5,"Nice demo, thanks. I had been eyeballing these for looking for wildlife (or sasquatch!) at night in the woods. I wasn't sure the range would be far enough to be useful though. Looked like you were getting pretty outdoor range with it though. Now I want one for sure :>"
6,"You put yourself through so much pain to teach us, I'm honored"
7,4:17 is the part we‚Äôve all been waiting for. üòÇ
8,This would be pretty useful to have as an EE student. Too bad about the price tag.
9,Also great for detecting areas that lack insulation in a home.
10,"No matter where he goes, everything explodes xD"
11,"I've had the seek thermal since it was first available and I love it I even got a macro lens for it to see more detail up close. You should try viewing the drain pipes under a sink with hot and cold water , it looks pretty neat . 
Also pouring hot water into the toilet or a bucket looks pretty nifty as well.. Good video , I am glad someone is as excited about it as I am ..:) Hopefully one day I'll be able to get the one with the high frame rate ."
12,I love your videos. My engineering and physics teachers have used your videos in class many times to explain stuff.
13,"I've loved your videos ever since I found your electric guitar video a couple years back.  Thank you for all the educational, and hilarious, moments!

Also the thermal sensor is awesome!  I'm applying for University soon, hoping to get into the ECE course there, do you have any tips regarding classes?"
14,"you read my mind with your heat seeing devices. I have been thinking of getting one to find out where the insulation has collapsed in my old home to minimize damage to the walls when I try and re insulate this summer (Winnipeg so no go in the winter). great looking product and as always, you make it fun and entertaining."
15,"I've been dying to get my hands on one of these. Between the literal drill holes in my walls to debugging overloaded power supply circuits. I've always wanted this tools in my workshop, but could never afford one on a college budget :/ Awesome Video!"
16,Hi Mehdi! Love your videos! I'd love to see more applications of cool electrical thingamajigs like this! I really like what Thomas Kim and Ludic Science do but you're much more entetaining :3
17,I've been having an issue with one room in the house being 10 degrees cooler when the door is shut in the window. I wasn't sure if the windows are leaking so this would be a good way to find where the air is going.
18,I wish I knew about this channel in 2016. I would have appreciated this more than any other human on earth.
19,Great video as always! I could use this to monitor heat output on the circuit boards I design as an EE student. Plus all of the other cool uses showed in the video.
20,Cool! I was thinking about how to convert heat loss to energy loss (GJ). Do you have any ideas? I was thinking about estimating the U-value of my house by using thermal imaging and also working on the Plank Law. Any thoughts on this? Thanks!
21,"Thanks for sharing this video! Like your video so muchüëç I used to have an issue with heat loss in my home. Then, I bought Infiray T2S+ thermal camera. I think that it's also a great device to find all the heat loss points in the house. The imaging is quite good for such an affordable price."
22,"You need to get rid of MSX when scanning it masks too much. Then tighten up that level (from what I could tell the span was ok). Finally never, ever, ever say you‚Äôre looking at the temperature since this type of thermography is only qualitative. I could go into the multiple reasons for this but unless you‚Äôre using some thermocouples and or thermistors (ideally) don‚Äôt mention anything about temps. Just my 0.02$."
23,thanks for the videos !
24,Could this detect rodents through the cavity or in the roofspace by pointing at it from below?
25,Which unit are you using?  Any recommendation of which one to get for pro use and home use?
26,"I am not normal, how can I get one of these?"
27,Fantastic product and even better review! What a terrific way to start a Saturday!!
28,"Just to clarify, the 260B has a measuring range of -20C to 550C, they simply made a mistake on the packaging, new packaging is corrected. Very nice review btw! I will be recieving the 260E tomorrow, I can""t wait to try it out."
29,"What I like most about this is the fact you don't need a phone or computer to use it. On the down side, when the battery fails I wonder how difficult it would be to replace. Also with a fixed focus, I wonder how close it can focus. The real benefit for me would be analysis of circuit boards. Do you think this will focus closely enough to isolate transistors, capacitors, etc?"
30,"Excellent video presentation,  review and comparison.
Having studied the specifications of various units, the
UNI-T UNI690b  is above average for the price.
Perhaps not perfect, however at this price it surpasses
some more expensive units.
For anyone looking for a less expensive unit,  I would sa
don't waste your $$$ --  One will be happier in the long term
to invest a little more and buy the UNI-T UNI690b.
IT wasn't so long ago that units with these specifications
would cost $1400"
31,"I used to have a FLuke thermal. It was a great product. I believe I bought it for about $9,000. It had a fusion system where thermal was fused with visible. I used it to inspect motor control centers, high power connections, fuses etc.  It was purchased to replace an old, $50,000 FLIR camera."
32,"The UTI690B thermal camera (basically the same as video) stopped working after charging it the first time. I was charging it with a wall adapter (only a USB cable is included) and it just doesn't turn on anymore. It's a fantastic camera, and I really enjoyed using it. I expect it's just a bad battery or hopefully just a bad batch."
33,"UNI-T is a good brand in my book. You need to spend a lot more to reach the features and often even the quality of an UNI-T with renowned established brand. I use one of their multimeters for more than 6 years and I am very very happy with it, it was a steal compared to the big name brand F__K_ what were you all thinking!? üòÑ"
34,"fantastic, I have been looking to get a good unit as I am working on new thermal diode designs (passive thermal) that is supposedly impossible according to the laws of entropy but my previous versions over my windows for the last 3 years saving over 200 dollars a month during the hottest months from the AC bill beg to differ, but I really want to refine this and need thermal imaging to properly know what is going on, so tweaking the design will be, hopefully at least, much easier. Thanks so much."
35,"My work phone is the Ulefone Armor 9, costs $550 upwards;
it has a FLIR camera, but default res is only 1080x1440. 
The rest of the phone makes it very easy to send footage in documentation for reports/emails.
It also has a youtube-live mode, and it has a night-vision filter 8-)
And it supports borescopes out of the box (it's just another app). 
I do not use the low-res Ulefone version, with its fixed connection :-/"
36,"Nice review, I would wait until available in USA because returning for warranty would be very costly!"
37,Nothing like looking for something new and finding someone you trust‚Äôs video review. üëçüèº
38,Is the lithium battery in the more advanced version replaceable? I'm not a fan of non-replaceable batteries. I'm assuming you can replace it if it's a 26650. Thanks for your help!
39,"given the specs for Field Of View (FOV) of 260b vs your older model,  i'm surprised when you compare the sample images they look like the FOV is the same between the cameras.  I would expect the FOV of the newer camera to be 5/3 more....(50deg / 30 deg)  Do you have any explanation for this?  it seems like manufacturers specs are often not reliable and is most likely the case here. 

Great video thank you for sharing."
40,The comparison shots were great.  Especially seeing that one of the meters was inaccurate by almost 10 degrees.
41,We really appreciate your work. Thanks again!
42,Great review. The cheaper FLIRs have come a long way. I think you just made a sale
43,Now that is what I would call a very enlightening video! üëçüëçüòâüòâüî•üî•
44,everyone reviewing thermal camera are ignoring the minimum distance you can use this device. Can i use it for close up circuit analysis? Like 20-30 cm away from an object?
45,Hi. Can you please recommend a cheap thermal camera for detecting short on pc motherboards? Looking for something cheap but that will do the job. Thanks In advance and happy new year!
46,EXCELLENT review - thanks!!
47,"I've got an old and formerly very expensive FLIR i7. It doesn't do a lot but what it does it does great. What really stinks about it though is the support and the software. I think the software is what makes or breaks such a camera, the display is nice to get information on a glance, ensure the correct settings and make sure you capture everything you want to capture but where those cameras really shine is the after-the-fact image analysis (or ""report generation"") and that is where FLIR really sucks. The free FLIR Tools have been last updated 2014,only  a few months after I bought the camera... They're slow, they lousy, effectively abandonware and this camera doesn't have the required firmware to do live capture so you have to go through a rather time consuming shoot/analyze cycle...

I'd really love to hear how good or bad the UNI-T software is... whatever my next thermal camera will be, it's definitely not going to be from FLIR."
48,"To record video with this camera I use OBS instead of the Windows camera app and it works great, although framerate drops. Also, using an OTG cable you can also record using smarthphone, so you can record on the fly. The resulting video is only what is shown on screen, no data or visible image. My camera firmware is v1.1.2"
49,12:30 - there is a way how to catch images without keys. Just press again on the trigger switch on the handler after getting the confirmation menu.
50,"I purchased one of these in December 2020, $470AUD with free DHL shipping from Hong Kong. I love it, great for electronic work and such bang for the buck when you consider the thermal resolution."
51,"It really depends on the use. For the typical homeowner, someone who just needs a toolbox camera, or maybe for some computer troubleshooting, these cheep little cameras do the trick just fine. When serious thermal analysis needs to be done in a professional setting or when you NEED to know the temperature of a something, I'd buy a FLIR. They cost alot more but...well let's just say that you get what you pay for."
52,"there is an option in the menu for autosave that does exactly that, it automatically saves the picture without asking for confirmation"
53,"There is a option in menu to save pictures automaticall (autosave) after pull the trigger, without confirmation afterwards."
54,Dont forget that there is a debate whether that thermal resolution is indeed the physical resolution of the sensor or it is an interpolated resolution. It seems many people have serious doubts about that spec
55,"It's $530 now on Amazon. I ordered the HIKMICRO B20 for same price that has similar features but includes WiFi casting, 25 Hz refresh rate, and Max/Min temperatures displayed."
56,"I use a ""Seek"" camera for my phone that I got about 8 years ago. Still working well, and I think they do some higher resolution models now."
57,"For saving images just press the trigger twice.
The camera is picky on video capturing software, I had success with e.g. Free2X Webcam Recorder.
Someone already decoded the image file format, so one can do postprocessing or whatever you like!"
58,"Hi,
Just watched your video after I got my own UTi260B today, I'm very happy with it.   In your video you say that it's only possible to capture video in the provided software.  But I use my UTi260B in OBS without problems to capture the thermal video stream.   (however it only works with direct cable to my PC, not via USB3 hub)."
59,"I did a review on one of these a few months ago, I like my one quite a lot.
The only trouble is I‚Äôm getting a lot of reports of them being out of stock and people are having to wait a long time to get them."
60,"If the visible camera is autofocus, then the overlay adjustment could be automatic, based on the discovered optical focal distance."
61,"I have that camera and the alignment with visible picture is pretty ok, but you don't really need that as thermal reaolution is high enough to see all details. Also, a tip, you could buy cheap macro lens (used in CO2 laser) and you get macro focus point. That  FLIR is no competitor"
62,I have one on the way from BG. It was out of stock for many months. Looking forward to finding all the hot spots around my house. Thanks for all you videos.

64,I am using flir e4 with hacked FW to e8 specs. It has better resolution (320x240). And I use 3 different Co2 laser focusing lens (ZnSe) for closeup shots. The only issue I have it is annoying slow 9hz update rate. And stupid network connectivity to download picture of course.
65,"Hello, would you recommend the UTi260M version? has about the same specs, but is cheaper, about 270$. I want to use it mostly for heat loss of my house, pluming, electrical fuses, etc."

68,What an awesome bit of technology! I‚Äôm just dipping into thermal and I‚Äôve been following T2 Pro since 2022. This review is what I needed to see. Thank you!
69,"Superb review. Thank you.

Looks like a great value gadget for those wanting to explore the pros and cons of thermal imaging before emptying the wallet/purse on a device that has top-of-the-range characteristics.

While I have an expensive Hik unit that is clearly not in the same league, if I was limited to sub-12ftlb shooting or just watching nature in the garden, I'd be very tempted to give it a try, especially given that you can record sound too.

This reminds me very much of my first home-built IR system and the biggest drawback with that set-up was the notable battery drain, which rendered my phone dead pretty quickly - maybe the current draw of this device isn't the same though? With that said, I wonder if there is a missed opportunity to incorporate a a 2x 18650 battery holder in the handgrip (along with a suitable voltage regulator). So, plug the thermal unit into the handle directly and then use the cable to connect the handle to the phone perhaps? Doubt it would cost much more to produce and would allow the user to add their own batteries for improved longevity if it's important to them."
70,Great video review Lancs very nice unit for the money and with all of the features makes it a good starter thermal. I've been looking at this one and the size of the unit and quality of the view is amazing. Thank you for doing this video I love the no BS review. Cheers brother
71,"Thanks for a great & honest review, very clear images & at a good price. I was looking at hand held monoculars today with a view to buying one but I think I‚Äôm gonna go for this & save quite a bit money. Cheers buddy üëçüá¨üáß"
72,The handle seems very solid. It is very useful on farms. Convenient and cost-effective. Pests are so annoying!
73,"Great video mate, good info, I‚Äôm just thinking of diving into thermal and this video has given me something to think about for sure üëç"
74,Seems a good unit. You could leave it set up and just add your phone when needed. Good review üëçüëç
75,"Nice review it looks really good and affordable, it would be better if you could get a bracket and attach it to the scope and the image quality is very good I've got a HIKMICRO lynx lc06 witch is good enough. But nice review thank you."
76,Great thermal monocular given the performance in such a small housing.
77,Thanks for the video.  What are the differences between t3pro and t2pro?
78,"Great honest review LVC, your right it is a little cumbersome maybe they could supply something like a phone mount similar to the ones used in cars (without the arm and sucker part) and a small mount that the imager could clip to, if you have an old working phone you could leave it setup ready to go?"
79,"Excellent üëå review,, seems like an invaluable piece of kit"
80,"Can you do a short film showing this on rabbits at 50-100 yards? I love the footage on the rats, but I would be using this on rabbits and hares out to 100+ and Coyotes at further distances for spotting."
81,"Can you have the temps displayed too? Like the less hunting oriented units? Be great for my business for pest control, not just hunting but also locating wasps nests too"
82,"Good morning Steve from Suffolk UK. I think your channel is one of the best informative channels in the UK. Others claim it but you do it? As for the new thermal your putting through its paces I have a thermal a 19 mm thermal handheld bit like the hike version but the problem with that is when you look through that thermal you see the rats in the brambles or bushes and then you pick up your rifle and look through the scope with infrared and you can't figure out whereabouts they were. So my idea is to get one of those little things and mount it on the side of the rifle, on a little picatinny mount and  the  camera  with a USB cable come back to the smallest mobile i phone I can find on the market to come close to the diopter on my night vision scope so I can quickly reference between what I'm looking at through the thermal and where the cross hairs on the night side are because I found this is a common problem  that I face when I'm out night shooting 99% of the time. I don't know what you think, but I think that's a brilliant idea if I make a really small bracket for this really small camera and it would not increase the weight of the rifle hardly at all. What are your thoughts on this please? Your loyal follower?"
83,Excellent honest review thanks üëçüèª
84,"I too want a decent, and honest review of any product. I do feel you have given that to us. It seems to be a great product, and reasonably priced as well. Thank you, and cheers from Texas."
85,"Thank you for an honest, articulate review of a great product.  Pleased to see you wearing a tee shirt showing the poppy wrapped in barbed wire.  Nice touch.   Rememberance Day 11th November, Lest we Forget."
86,Nice kit good price totally get the honesty thing bud cheers for the force wear app found in comments great videos out on tree rats soon üëç
87,"Continuous commercial for Flir.
Lawyers love such videos"
88,"I have been a certified thermographer for about 15 years and use a high end FLIR for inspections of electrical gear. Good explanation of reflectivity, emissivity and transmittance. Most casual users don‚Äôt know about these pitfalls of infrared thermography. Hollywood doesn‚Äôt help‚Ä¶ When people see a movie and cops are using IR to see through buildings to locate bad guys, I have to explain that‚Äôs not possible. What you demonstrated with tinfoil is a great demo of emissivity and reflectivity. Tinfoil does serve a purpose in thermography while in the field. When using infrared on a items with high emissivity, I will use a piece of tinfoil to measure background temperature. Wad up the foil and unfold it multiple times so the surface is full of micro wrinkles. Point the dull side toward the area you need a reflected temperature then point the IR camera at the tinfoil. The dull finish and micro wrinkles provides a good average temperature of the area it‚Äôs pointing. I can enter the reflected temperature into the reporting software to obtain an accurate component temp. Obviously you want to shoot at an angle so your body temp is not included in the average temp seen in the reflection of the foil."
89,I was really impressed with your ability to follow a fully loaded circuit through the wall/drywall. For those times when you have no idea where a wire is routed...
90,I borrowed an IR camera a while back & went through a similar tour of the house and surroundings but even though I feel I'm a creative person you take it to the next level Matthias ! I obviously had a lot more exploring to do . I was particularly impressed with the see-thru garbage bag and the temperature difference you see in the Boot-prints while walking through the snow.
91,As an engineer this is easily the most interesting video I‚Äôve seen all year.
92,"This is a smart company. They pay you pennies on the dollar compared to ""real"" advertising, yet your video is very effective at making me want to buy one of these.
It looks very fun, but also useful. My favorites were the stud finder and wire tracer."
93,So interesting! I really enjoyed the examples of infrared interactions at the end. I love that you included the ffmpeg command. The dual camera setup is great too! I hope these thermal cameras keep coming down in price.
94,"Fascinating. I never knew such an alternative world existed but now that I do, I want one of those! As a carpenter, what an excellent way to find studs, cables, pipes and so on, anywhere in a building - but it's also a fun and unique eye-opener in everyday life."
95,"Funnily enough the most interesting part was the chair.
I work in a 3D art industry and what I saw with the chair really reminded me of what we call ""baking"", which is basically fixing lighting or other data onto an object (specifically its texture) so it doesn't change.
So the chair was lit in specific way and that was baked in, so when you turned it, the lit areas stayed the same, even though the source of ""light"" didn't match up anymore."
96,The shot of the running water was so much more interesting than I expected.
97,Using an IR camera to find studs is genius.
98,"This is so genuinely interesting to watch!! The deeper snow is warmer, the electrical wires in the walls, the office chair!! Thank you!"
99,13:37 (nice) that pattern in the water is so cool! Looks exactly like some art you'd see at some nerd convention us viewers might attend
100,What a nice video. The water looked absolutely rad.
101,"tech like this is amazing, basically access to a whole new dimension"
102,This is one of the coolest videos on YouTube. Crazy that it‚Äôs essentially a sponsored product placement on your second channel.
103,"I bought my Cat S62 Pro because of its FLIR cam, it is really usefull, as you have illustrated. During the cold winter here in Norway I checked all the temp. losses from outside, but the most important one was when I checked all the junction boxes in the house, I did find one were the connectors where going bad and I did fix that, no fire here!  At work I can use my Cat S62Pro to check conveyer belt motors, and electric stuff that I work with. Really usefull phone!"
104,"Thanks for your videos, always informative and fun....like life should always be."
105,"Man, what a super fascinating video.  It was really neat to see so much IR video all at once like that.  You just get so used to seeing the world in visible light that its always a bit startling to see the world differently like this.  Maybe TOPDON will release a UV camera one day and you can build a triple mount."
106,"We picked one of these types up at work, great gadget to have around. Fun fact, few years ago the cheap FLIR ones were only 9hz because of US export restrictions on IR cameras. Now the cheap chinese ones can give you glorious 25FPS / Hz IR!"
107,"Very interesting, and an excellent demonstration of the utility of thermal imaging. The emissivity of different materials and surface finishes is fascinating too, so I would be keen to see how you tackle that subject Matthias. Thank you, always learning with you."

134,Cool they took the radio and put in a thermal imagager. Way to go Klein.
135,I was looking for one to examine boards and look for chips running hot. I think this will work well for that.
136,"I'm really looking to buy the new borescope. If you could do a review on it, it would be awesome. I want to see how it compares in video quality to the HF one or similar."
137,it always amazes me how shoddy construction is at the home level. It's all about the looks and zero about the function unless you build it yourself or manage the build.

162,Great for home! ‚ù§Ô∏è
163,Thanks for this!
164,Thanks for sharing
165,I dont want one for home inspection . I want to know where people have been . Where they have been sitting or laying down .
166,Alina a Ad covered the video.  YouTube fail.
167,"Alibaba Ad covered video , YouTube fail.  YouTube autocorrected Alibaba to jibbberish"
168,Rubbish! This is not a review!! NOT SUBSCRIBING TO THIS MISLEADING CHANNEL!!
169,"Didn't get this at all.  It's not a review of any of the devices, it's just to show what a TI camera can do (which we all know).  It's just an advertisement for the cameras,  What a shame.  It could have been very useful but it was just a misrepresentation."

173,Can you damage an infrared thermometer by pointing it at something too hot?
174,"IS it available in India, and the cost Please"
175,"Which is better to me,  if i used for finding out the water presents under the tiles...
Plz rply..."
176,Which one is preferred for body temperature reading
177,Thermal camera can how long it detect
178,Which thermometer is better-Infrared or thermal?
179,"please, i need to buy the thermal camera, give me the web site to buy it"
180,How much price
181,What a great video with informative contentüëçI also like Infiray P2 Pro thermal camera. It really amazed me because it supports secondary analysis of the temperature data in the thermal images. And I can connect it directly to the smartphone for plug-and-play accurate temperature measurement. Very convenient!
182,Thanks
183,"I'm sure you've figured this out by now, but it's actually an issue of parallax - why the thermal square appears below the electrical outlet. It's in fact the outlet itself. The visible and infrared images don't always align. There may be a setting to help adjust."
184,The spots in the ceiling could be caused by gaps in insulation or places where mice have eaten insulation.  What you want to do is rapidly change the temperature in the environment if you want to 'see' water.   Home inspectors who use these undergo training and certification so they don't go unnecessarily freaking out homebuyers about roof leaks...
185,"Thermal uncovers many issues not observed by the human eye. I use several Flir products, E96 backed up with a Protimeter moisture meters MMS3. I like the built in hydrometer. Nice video uncovering many issues-we never have enough tools in the moisture and thermal imaging inspection business. Thank for the video"
186,I'm changing careers from public school teacher to home inspector.  I appreciated your video.  Thanks for posting.
187,"Awsome video, I‚Äôm a public insurance adjuster looking to upgrade my moisture meter from lowes to a flir mr277. Before such an investment I want to make sure the tech actually works. This video was super informative and I feel much better about spending that much money on a tool I‚Äôm going to be using daily. Thanks!"
188,"Thanks so much for this video, I want it to check where the heat is coming in from and make my home cooler during the summer. 

This is the only video I found of someone waking around with the camera, it allowed me to check how far away I can look with the camera. It seems it will suit me perfectly!"
189,Thermal cameras are one of the handiest tools for finding issues. Too bad they're still so expensive for good ones
190,"Hello, I have a question: I would like to make an infrared measurement in a region where the climate is incredibly hot (up to 50¬∞C / 122¬∞F). What do I have to consider when entering the measurement parameters? Can I leave the default settings as they are or do I have to change them (e.g. emissivity)?"
191,"Yeah electric fittings letting draughts in  seem to be responsible for some cold spots, sockets, light fittings and switches."
192,"That was nice.
Thank you"
193,Hi Mark.  Thanks for the video.  Hey what model infrared camera are you using.
194,I live where it's hot and my A/C is more important than a heater. Would this work looking for hot air coming in?
195,"I've been searching for this type of content. All of the product review I each so far are bad. They show the product but they don't walk around showing it like the way you did. 
I will be buying one soon and be a video about it soon. I see fun things with it and also to check where the cold air in coming in from my home to so I can fix the problem. Great video. I enjoy it. Thanks."
196,Do you have any referrals in the st. Louis area that can find a leak and repair?
197,Hi Mark question i try to buy Flir one pro.what you think I can see water leak as well.I now you have better camera.Thanks Seb
198,"Which model camera are you using here?  I recently purchased a Flir C5,  as I walk through a home it freezes momentarily & says recalibrating.   I didn't see your do this at all..."
199,You found alot of leaks. Do you need to fix all the leaks or just the major leaks?
200,WOW! If I'm in your area your my realtor!

Too bad Thermal cameras (to say nothing of googles) are ummm, not cheap.¬† Who knows, maybe 10 or 15 years from now people could get such things the size of sunglasses and reasonably priced.¬† Technology marches on after all.

One could use IR instead though, maybe?¬† Wouldn't look as psychedelic though, I expect."

250,"Thank you for the excellent review. In future reviews, could you please show the MAXIMUM usable distance and setting? It would help those of us interested in using it for finding energy leaks in buildings. Thank you."
251,"Excellent, thorough review. I'd definitely pick up this model if I wanted a handheld unit. Excellent price for the resolution, and UNI-T makes solid products. The temperature switching delay sure is a drawback. I assume it's recalibrating to ensure high accuracy. It's too bad you can't record video directly.

One thing not covered was the USB functionality. From what I understand, it appears as a normal USB camera so you can use any PC program to view/record it, or even hook it to a smartphone as many of those support USB cameras. So you could record video on the go with a smartphone, and view things on a larger screen."
252,"You can buy an official macro lens from Uni-T for the UTi260B, the part number is UT-Z002. I personally just purchased the UTi260E with the UT-Z003 macro lens, very excited to receive it!

Also note that the UTi-320E has a resolution of 320*240"
253,"Thanks for this review, I've been waiting for one on this model. I see there are macro lenses available for the thermal imaging part. For the money it's very good."
254,Nice review.. I ordered the uni-t uti260b from china and is currently on the way now. Can't wait to test it out.
255,"I have the uti260B and have not been able to get USB mode to work. I have tried their own software as well as obs. Windows 10 basically says the device is unrecognized. I really think you should have covered this functionality, recording video and what the software can do."
256,"Nice price for what you get but perhaps a little more time demonstrating the 2 camera mode which will be the reason someone will choose this model would have been better as this 'Fusion' mode can be great if the software can align the two images properly and also can you adjust the transparency of the 2 images to show more or less of the visible light image ? I have used the dual camera system and when set up properly it's a must for me ! and again that is if the software and optics are up to it, demonstrating this on the Arduino or some other board would have been nice too as I feel that you skipped the main reason for buying this model (second perhaps to the resolution) Even with my little winge still a great review...cheers."
257,"This camera with macro lens is better than infiray t2l/t2s for home use? Electronic, device, pcb etc."
258,"I like your review, thanks!"
259,"Thanks, excellent review"
260,Will the UNI-T Thermal Camera Macro Lens UT-Z002 fit his camera
261,I wonder if this uses the GST212W sensor from Global Sensor Technology?
262,"So, for a $300USD budget, what unit is the absolute must buy? I only have an iPhone"
263,My high gain image is clearer than low gain. Is that normal? Low gain is noisy and static
264,"The ""rainbow"" color palette is probably for Predator-fans..."
265,O filmare foarte proasta! Chiar nu vezi reflexele alea???
266,"The sensor resolution is 32 x 32.
Frame rate is 9 Hz.
NETD: 150 mK
Those specs are about as low as you can get, but it's still cool to see this technology slowly becoming more available to the common consumer. A NETD of 150 mK means it will be able to detect a 0.27¬∞F difference in temperature."
267,I am going to DIY solar system and this will be great for making the house efficient before sizing the system and to check the connection after! Great review thanks!
268,Do you think this could be used to find air coming out of ground for cave detection?
269,I‚Äôd use it to detect heat loss in my home in the winter in order to plastic my windows right.
270,On sale right now for 159 with 20 dollar coupon. Nice tool to have for those just in case moments!
271,What would you think its ability to detect heat behind Sheetrock.   I need something to see beehives inside walls. They give off a good deal of heat.
272,"Its up to 219.00 now, still not bad."
273,1794? I would love to come over and metal detect on your property!
274,Extremely dangerous if the mains voltage gets ahold of you
275,"Would it help find mice behind a wall?
Also, does it work as a night vision device?"
276,Can you use it to find air leaks on a piece of machinery that uses air cylinders?
277,Thermal cameras help with lithium-ion battery repairs.
278,It's specs are that of a $150 device while right now costs $220... Cool but seems over priced.
279,Would it take pictures of footprints outside at night after you've been there like tracking somebody
280,Can this be used to detect dry wood termites ?
281,Display resolution: 160 x 128
282,what's the resolution? I'd try it for circuit board repair.
283,What is the resolution is it more or less than 14400 p
284,How far will it go? I‚Äôm looking for a thermal for coyote hunting but they are all crazy money
285,Will it find wall studs? Wires? Pipes?
286,Omg finally a video were humans don‚Äôt die üòÇ
287,"Thermal vision has some advantages over the natural visible light vision that we have as you mentioned in your video. However, a disadvantage of having thermal vision instead of visible light vision is that high spatial resolution in microscopy would be harder to achieve because microscopic objects that are smaller than half the wavelength of the light that the microscope detects cannot be resolved, i.e., seen distinctly, but will be seen as a blur. Infrared light has longer wavelengths than visible light.

In that case, we may need to conduct research into developing microscopes that can convert the then-invisible ""visible light"" into visible infrared light like how thermal cameras convert infrared light into visible light."
288,"Wait.. so you‚Äôre telling me that this is a what if video and we‚Äôre not going to die?

IMPOSSIBLE."
289,"Thermal vision would be nice but you should have a function that
you can deactivate it and see normally again."
290,If we had thermal vision we could have easily figured out who farted
291,"Can please do a video on what if we had ultravoilet vision? I've been curious about it ever since I saw the film ""Pitch Black."""
292,"Thanks for the interesting video. Couple of quick questions: (1) IR have three classification (near, mid and far), in order to develop IR stealth material/uniform which one of the classes shall be focused? Isn't it that if someone make far-IR stealth then it will cover both near and mid IR stealth as well? 
(2) Which of these three classes (Near, mid and far IR) are used by military for detecting enemies?"
293,"great video, been watching since you only had a only thousands of subs. keep up the good work :)"
294,What if we had the ability to permeate through objects?
295,"I have seen some videos out there about thermal imaging, where the surface is smooth so you can see a reflection. In thermal vision how is it you can see the outline of the reflection when the surface should be cold?"
296,"I have another idea for another what if video, I am totally blind. And I‚Äôm always wondering about different what if‚Äôs about sound here‚Äôs my idea, what if we had digital hearing? Or what if we had supersonic hearing and rather than hear somebody in the next room, you could hear people from another Country or even another state."
297,We wouldn‚Äôt need to use our camera on our phone to see if the batteries in the TV remote are dead anymore! A++ from me!
298,"If we have thermal vision..
1. we can not use phones, computers,etc
2. can not read.
3. No use of expensive clothes.
4. can't see all colours..No greenery..
5. can't differentiate between many things with no heat..
6.
7.
8.
.
.
etc.."
299,If we have normal thermal vision I think we will invent a goggle that is able to let us turn off our thermal vision üòÇ
300,Your all videos are amazing and your content is just superb üëçüëç
301,"Meanwhile, in an alternate universe:
what if humans has visible vision?"
302,Think about it. Thermal has a lot of positives but in this case it has more negatives. Yes you can see heat but you only see heat. Developments like mobile devices would become impossible as the screen would be one colour. So would other technological developments. Determination of basic materials would be very hard. Construction of new items very hard. If we suddenly got thermal vision then survival could be a lot easier but it's a double edged sword with humans. But making new things would become very much close to impossible.
303,What if we can communicate telephatically?
304,I love the fact that mark Zuckerberg was behind him
305,"‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs not nuclear radiation, it‚Äôs electromagnetic radiation.‚Äù

307,"The background music you used is the same as my Notification Sounds, so everytime I watch your vids, I thought I got a message"
308,You‚Äôre like the new bill nye the science guyüíØüòÇ
309,Bro just gave me a whole science lesson In like 60 seconds
310,"Nice video but a couple corrections. Nuclear radiation is electromagnetic radiation too. Infrared is low energy radiation, even lower than visible light which is also em radiation. While nuclear ones like xray is high energy radiation. 
Other one is that infrared doesn't come after red, its before it. Red follows rest of the colours since its the longest wavelength and least energy, all other colours are higher energy and come after it. Before it lies even lower energy waves like infrared and microwaves."
311,Your lectures are true and honest
312,"One correction that nuclear radiation is also on the electromagnetic chart but to the far right so visible light, ultraviolet light, and radio waves aren't as strong and won't give you cancer, actually ultraviolet but u would need a good amount, although they don't give cancer they can still raise your body temp"
313,What is the cheapest one that has a built in normal camera too so it looks better?
314,"Actually infrared radiation, I think it's because hot things emit more IR than cold things"
315,Love the video man
316,Yo bruh wts the budget alternative for mavic enterprises 2 advance for industrial thermal imaging purpose
317,Nuclear radiation IS electromagnetic radiation. Look at the short wavelength side of the electromagnetic spectrum.
318,"House on fire 
„ÉΩ(`–¥¬¥Ôºõ)/"
319,Can it see thru blankets? Pls send me a link of the vid review when done.
320,Nuclear radiation is also a part of the electromagnetic spectrum actually.
321,"""nuclear radiation"" is a combination of alpha, beta and gamma rays, and while alpha and beta radiation are not on the electromagnetic spectrum as they are not pure energy and instead are highly energetic atoms as as opposed to pure energy, gamma rays are classed as electromagnetic radiation, and are therefore on the same scale as infrared, just much more powerful."

GreatScott,    Hot glue and Screw."
334,"Once you have such a camera, you automatically start to find more applications for it.  Like finding leaks in the insulation of your house in winter.  Or finding where your cat is hiding in your bedroom."
335,Personally a thermal camera + ZnSe lens has been invaluable to me in troubleshooting shorted boards. This made a thermal camera well worth it for me.
336,"As limited as the DIY option may be, I actually think I could use it for diagnosing hot spots on PCBs, though the drench it in alcohol method might work better."
337,"If the surface is shiney according to FLIR, just put a piece of painters/masking tape on and you can then measure the objects temp."
338,"You could calibrate the DIY camera for use at a set distance and use it stationary. That way you could set something down in front of it and depending on the size and how far away it was, you could adjust the parameters to measure the X, Y of where the hot pixels are and know very accurately where the component is. It just wouldn't be a handy handheld tool for quick observations."
339,I like your perseverence with getting a good solution with your diy projects! Not an easy task to beat manufacturers in having great products!
340,"One option you didn't explore was the hacking that was done with the SEEK thermal imaging cameras. They are very affordable IR modules with a USB interface, but it's all proprietary. I think they managed to crack the older models but the newer models only produce a raw unprocessed image last time I looked into it."
341,"One thing the commercial camera does that the DIY version does not is overlay the thermal image, which has a fairly low resolution, over a very basic black and white visible image. It gives a lot better view into what's actually going on. If you were to add that to the DIY project, and say, replace the ESP32 with a Raspberry Pi Zero and camera module to add the visible image display, this project can be a lot better."
342,It‚Äôs uncanny how well your videos sync up with what I‚Äôm working on. I feel like just a few days ago I was thinking about this exact same problem.
343,"Awesome work, dude! Thanks a lot! üòÉ

345,"something you didn't think of: you can simply overlay a LCD without a backlight, over the thermal image, it may need another esp32, but might be worth trying, using another esp or controller would also mean you could lock it to the same framerate as the thermal camera, without needing one controller to do too much work"
346,"The Flir E4 can be ""upgraded"" to the 320x240 E8 with a firmware replacement. Huge value, and you can Google it easily."
347,"I got myself a cheap off-brand version. The resolution is about half way between your DIY and the FLIR; I've used it now and then for troubleshooting and/or augmenting my videos with stills - as it cannot record video. But then, the price was also half way between your options: about 250$ IIRC."
348,"You can always use a laser pointer to show where it's taking the readings or will that interfear with the reading, example laser points at the component imager reads temperate that way you don't need high resolution"
349,"Very helpful video , I just joined a thermal camera company one month ago as calibration engineer üòÄüëçüëçüëç
And from the bottom we start from 80*80 sensor and at last we have 640 sensor of Ulis (a French company) very expensive üòÇüòÇ"
350,"Actually you can also buy a USB OTG thermal camera which can be plugged into a mobile phone. But anyways, this was a good and informative video! üëç"
351,"Amazing as always.  Thank you for explaining how to troubleshoot with it.  I am going to try that (because my circuits rarely work first time). 
It is obvious that the components you tested for your DIY version are not granular enough for the kind of work you mentioned.
In my mind, that just means you haven't found a better camera module yet with a DIY price tag.  If you could bring the DIY version under $250, then it would still be a good DIY win assuming getting better resolution.
It seems as if finding a module with DMA transfer and hardware DSP to handle the correlational computations would probably require an embedded MCU or PIC, so the price would much higher.
You kinda missed out for this video because tearing down the expensive camera could have shown what model components they use."
352,"Scot, could you try to spend the same amount of money for DIY projects as you would for the ""buy"" option?
This would give a real answer if DIY vs buy. 

Or a small modification: How much money do you need to spend to match the ""buy"" option?
Anyway you doing a great job, I'm from a completely different industry but I'm having a good time while watching your videos."
